##  Advanced Guides and Common Workflows

While the API Reference provides the "what," this section provides the "how." These guides walk through common, real-world scenarios, demonstrating how to orchestrate multiple API calls to accomplish a complete business process. They are designed to illustrate the power of the API in a practical context and provide a blueprint for building sophisticated integrations.18

### **Tutorial 1: The Complete Maintenance Lifecycle**

This tutorial follows a single maintenance request from creation to completion, showcasing how different user roles (Tenant, Property Manager, Vendor) interact with the API to manage the process. This workflow is a cornerstone of property management and demonstrates the API's ability to facilitate complex, multi-actor collaborations.

#### **Step 1: A Tenant Reports an Issue**

The process begins when a tenant discovers a problem in their unit. The tenant, Jane Doe, will use a mobile app (built by a third-party developer using this API) to submit a maintenance request.

1. **Authentication:** Jane's app authenticates her using the OAuth Authorization Code flow. The app receives an access token with the TENANT role and the work_orders.write scope.
2. **API Call:** The app makes a POST request to /v1/work-orders to create the new request. The request body includes the property and unit IDs, which the app knows from Jane's lease information, along with her description of the problem.

   ```bash
   \# Request made with Jane's (Tenant) access token
   POST /v1/work-orders
   Authorization: Bearer JANE_TENANT_TOKEN
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "property\_id": "prop\_1A2b3C4d5E6f7G8h",
     "unit\_id": "unit\_9I8j7K6l5M4n3O2p",
     "title": "Dishwasher not draining",
     "description": "The dishwasher ran a cycle last night but is still full of water this morning.",
     "priority": "MEDIUM"
   }
   ```

3. **Result:** The API creates the work order with a status of OPEN and returns a 201 Created response. The system also fires a work_order.created webhook event.

#### **Step 2: A Property Manager Assigns the Job**

The property manager, John Smith, receives a notification about the new work order (triggered by the webhook from Step 1\) on his management dashboard.

1. **Authentication:** John logs into his dashboard, which authenticates him and obtains an access token with the PROPERTY_MANAGER role.
2. View Details: John's dashboard retrieves the details of the new work order using its ID.
   GET /v1/work-orders/wo_abc123def456
3. **Assign to Vendor:** John decides to assign the job to "Reliable Appliance Repair," a trusted vendor. He finds their ID (vendor_xyz789) and uses the "assign" endpoint.

   ```bash
   \# Request made with John's (Property Manager) access token
   PUT /v1/work-orders/wo\_abc123def456/assign
   Authorization: Bearer JOHN\_MANAGER\_TOKEN
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "assignee\_id": "vendor\_xyz789"
   }
   ```

4. **Result:** The API updates the work order's assigned_to field and changes its status to IN_PROGRESS. A work_order.status_changed webhook is fired.

#### **Step 3: A Vendor Completes the Work**

The vendor, Reliable Appliance Repair, receives a notification of the new assignment. A worker, Bob, is dispatched to handle the repair.

1. **Authentication:** Bob uses his company's mobile app, which authenticates him as a Worker for the vendor_xyz789 entity. He gets an access token scoped to his assigned tasks.
2. **View and Comment:** Bob views the work order details. After inspecting the dishwasher, he adds a comment to update the property manager.

   ```bash
   \# Request made with Bob's (Worker) access token
   POST /v1/work-orders/wo_abc123def456/comments
   Authorization: Bearer BOB_WORKER_TOKEN
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
   "text": "The drain pump is clogged. I have cleared the obstruction. Running a test cycle now."
   }
   ```

3. **Complete the Job:** After confirming the dishwasher is working correctly, Bob updates the work order's status to COMPLETED.

   ```bash
   \# Request made with Bob's (Worker) access token
   PUT /v1/work-orders/wo_abc123def456
   Authorization: Bearer BOB_WORKER_TOKEN
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
   "status": "COMPLETED"
   }
   ```

4. **Result:** The API updates the work order status. Another work_order.status_changed webhook is fired, notifying the property manager and the tenant that the work is done. The entire lifecycle is now recorded in the system.

### **Tutorial 2: Onboarding a New Property and its Digital Twin**

This guide is for administrators and describes the process of adding a new property to the platform and establishing its corresponding Digital Twin.

1. Create the Property: First, create the physical Property resource.

```http
   POST /v1/properties with the property's name and address.
```

2. Add Units: For a multi-unit property, create each Unit resource, linking it to the property_id from the previous step.
   ```http
   POST /v1/properties/propId/units for each unit.
   ```
3. Create the Digital Twin: Once the physical structure is defined, create the DigitalTwin resource. This is done via a dedicated endpoint that automatically links it to the property.
   ```http
   POST /v1/properties/propId/digital-twin
   ```
4. Upload the Model: With the DigitalTwin object created, upload the primary BIM or 3D model file. This populates the twin's structural layer.

   ```http
   POST /v1/digital-twins/twinId/model
   ```

5. Register Sensors: Finally, register the known IoT sensors within the building, associating them with the DigitalTwin and, if possible, with specific assets or locations within the model.
   ````http
   POST /v1/digital-twins/twinId/sensors for each sensor.
    ```
   The property is now fully onboarded, with both its physical and digital representations established in the Property+ platform.
   ````

### **Best Practices for Data Handling**

To ensure your integration is efficient and performant, follow these best practices when retrieving data.

#### **Pagination**

Endpoints that can return a large number of items (like /v1/properties or /v1/work-orders) are paginated. Our API uses cursor-based pagination, which is more efficient for large datasets than offset-based pagination.

- Use the limit query parameter to specify the number of results per page (e.g., limit=50).
- The response object will include a has_more boolean field. If true, there are more results available.
- To fetch the next page, take the id of the _last_ item in the current page's result set and pass it as the starting_after parameter in your next request.

Example:

```http
GET /v1/work-orders?limit=25\&starting_after=wo_last_item_id
```

#### **Filtering and Sorting**

Many list endpoints support filtering and sorting via query parameters. This allows you to retrieve only the data you need, reducing payload size and processing overhead.

- Filtering: To filter results, use query parameters that correspond to the resource's fields. For example, to retrieve only open work orders:
  ```http
  GET /v1/work-orders?status=OPEN
  ```
- Sorting: Use the sort_by parameter to specify a field to sort on and sort_direction (asc or desc) to control the order.
  ```http
  GET /v1/work-orders?sort_by=created_at\&sort_direction=desc
  ```

Refer to the documentation for each specific endpoint to see the available filterable and sortable fields.

#### **Sparse Fieldsets**

To further reduce response sizes, you can request that the API return only specific fields from a resource. This is particularly useful when you only need a few pieces of information from a large object.

Use the fields query parameter with a comma-separated list of the field names you want.

Example: To get only the ID, name, and address of properties:

```http
GET /v1/properties?fields=id,name,address
```
