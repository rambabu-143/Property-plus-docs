##  Core API Concepts and Data Models

This section provides a reference for the fundamental data objects that make up the Property+ API. Understanding these core resources, their attributes, and their relationships is essential for effective integration. Each object is represented in JSON format in API requests and responses.17

### **Property**

The Property object represents a distinct physical property, such as an apartment building, an office complex, or a single-family home. It is the top-level container for most other resources.

- **id** string: A unique identifier for the property.
- **name** string: The display name of the property (e.g., "The Grandview Apartments").
- **address** object: A structured address object.
- **type** string: The type of property (e.g., RESIDENTIAL_MULTIFAMILY, COMMERCIAL_OFFICE).
- **created_at** timestamp: The timestamp when the property was created.

```json
{
